# TicTacToe-using-MinMax-Algorithm

This is a more rudimentary version of Tic-Tac_Toe. The game is played in the console by two agents (Player 1 and Player 2). Please get your console dirty by playing Tic-Tac-Toe.

A slightly improved version of Tic-Tac_Toe with Artificial agents using MinMax and Aplha Beta pruning will be uploaded soon.
