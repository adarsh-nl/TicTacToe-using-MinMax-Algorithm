# TicTacToe-using-MinMax-Algorithm

This is a rudimentary version of Tic-Tac_Toe. The game is played in the console by an artificial Agent and a player. Few stuffs like pattern matching has been used in this program ("match"). So I suggest using python 3.10 and above.


I used @javacodingcommunity code as an inspiration and made few changes so that it supports both minmax and alpha beta pruning.

Please get your console dirty by playing Tic-Tac-Toe.
